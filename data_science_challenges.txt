Company X is building a fiber network (Program) with vendors. They are using an engineering system to track the fiber build progress 
and an invoicing system for vendor invoicing. Vendor submits invoicing to get paid and the external labor CapEX is booked 
when its goods receipt (GR_DATE).The invoicing on external labor is based on the fiber build milestones using contractual bid units 
and milestone percentage..

Below data sets 
Program’s fiber build progress build progress_ext.xlsx
Milestone associated contractual bid unit and milestone percentage milestone bid unit.csv
Invoicing data invoice_ext.xlsx


Senior management wants to have visibility of Program spend. The 2020 budget for external labor CapEX is $2 billion. 
You are tasked to present to senior management about your findings and recommendations.

What is the total external labor cost as of the program to date and year to date, nationally and at market level 
How much external labor CapEX do you forecast for 2020, nationally and at market level `	
In addition, what patterns (if any) do you find for invoicing lag ( invoice date - milestone complete date)

(Hints Further information might be obtained upon request, or assumptions may be made for your analysis.)

Notes
Please submit your analysis results along with codes and powerpoint in separate files.

Fiber build progress is tracked at span level using fqn_id.
For simplicity, only need to track external labor related to following milestones
MILESTONE_NM in ('1-Engineering','2-Construction','4-Project Management') and 
FIBER_MILESTONE in ('Permits Received','Cable Placed','Spliced and Tested');
